It's built with software development principles in mind, aiming to make agent creation feel more like traditional software engineering. ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, meaning it can work with various AI models and be deployed in different environments, though it's optimized for the Google ecosystem, particularly Gemini models and Vertex AI.\n\nKey features of the ADK include:\n*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Enables the creation of modular and scalable applications by composing specialized agents.\n*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Allows for defining workflows with sequential, parallel, or loop agents, or dynamic routing driven by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Agents can be equipped with pre-built tools (like search and code execution), custom functions, third-party libraries, or even other agents.\n*   **Code-First Development:** Developers define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code, offering robust debugging, versioning, and deployment flexibility.\n*   **Built-in Evaluation and Safety Features:** Tools for testing, evaluating, and ensuring the security of agents.\n\nThe Agent Development Kit (ADK) SDK is available in the following languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Go**\n*   **Java**\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### 2.4 How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1.
